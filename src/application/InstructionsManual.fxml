An electoral system or voting system is a set of rules that determine how elections and referendums are conducted and how their results are determined. Political electoral systems are organized by the Department of Federal Governement - Election Commission of Pakistan&#10;&#10;Instructions: Electronic voting, a form of computer-mediated voting in which voters make their selections with the aid of a computer. The voter usually chooses with the aid of a screen display, although audio interfaces can be made available for voters with visual disabilities. To understand electronic voting, it is convenient to consider four basic steps in an election process: &#10;1. Ballot composition, in which voters make choices; ballot casting, in which voters submit their ballots.&#10;2. Ballot recording, in which a system records the submitted ballots; and tabulation, in which votes are counted. &#10;3. Ballot casting, recording, and tabulation are routinely done with computers even in voting systems that are not, strictly speaking, electronic. &#10;&#10;Mostly due to security and access concerns, most large-scale electronic voting is currently held in designated precincts using special-purpose machines. This type of voting mechanism is referred to as electronic-voting&#10;" wrapText="true" BorderPane.alignment="CENTER" />
